       The project focused on designing and building a compact remote-controlled car capable of performing across multiple events with both speed and precision. 
        The drivetrain was engineered to provide smooth power delivery, directional changes, and gear shifting under varying loads. A three speed transmission—low, 
        high, and reverse—was implemented to balance torque and velocity requirements. Shifting was achieved through a servo driven dog clutch actuated by a rack and pinion 
        system, allowing reliable gear changes in real time. CAD modeling and FEA simulations guided the design, ensuring the drivetrain could withstand competition stresses while 
        staying within strict size and cost constraints.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">What</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
         The main objective was to create a vehicle with a functional multi-speed automatic transmission that could handle diverse performance challenges. Forward motion was driven through high and low gears, while reverse was enabled by an idler gear. Key goals included:
	      •	Delivering consistent torque with smooth gear engagement.
	      •	Achieving high velocity for speed events and high torque for precision tasks.
	      •	Maintaining reliable control under load without compromising traction.
	      •	Meeting all dimensional, weight, and budget restrictions.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">How</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The drivetrain was designed in <strong>Fusion 360</strong> using laser-cut acrylic plates, 3D-printed gears, and metal shafts. A servo driven dog clutch with a rack-and-pinion linkage enabled smooth shifting between low, high, 
			and reverse gears. Iterative prototyping and <strong>FEA simulations</strong> guided refinements,ensuring the transmission could handle torque demands while staying lightweight and reliable.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Results</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
         The vehicle successfully shifted between all three gears under load, providing smooth transitions and consistent performance. Testing confirmed sufficient torque for precision tasks and high speed for 
		racing, with FEA results matching physical performance. Iterative improvements resolved early meshing and alignment issues, resulting in a robust and functional RC drivetrain.
