     The RingBot is a robot that combines the strengths of wheeled and legged locomotion using a large monocycle frame with two 3-DoF legs. 
        The project focused on re-engineering the design and optimizing its motion control system to improve balance, navigation, and adaptability across varied 
        terrains.

        <p class="text-gray-700">
        Our objective was to rebuild the RingBot with improved mechanical and control systems. Key goals included:
	    • Completing mechanical redesigns to fit new batteries and improve stability.
	    • Fully assembling and wiring the wheel, legs, and drive modules.
	    • Developing low-level motor controllers and reinforcement learning agents for locomotion.
	    • Ensuring smooth communication between onboard hardware and external devices.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">How</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
         We redesigned and 3D-printed components in SolidWorks, reinforced the frame with carbon fiber tubing, and assembled Dynamixel 
          motors with updated leg structures to house LiPo batteries. Wiring was completed through custom soldered connections and integration 
          with a Raspberry Pi Zero running Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 Humble. For motion control, we developed low-level controllers and trained reinforcement 
          learning agents in simulation using a URDF model of the robot. These models were deployed onto the hardware with optimized communication and asynchronous control.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Results</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
        The RingBot was fully assembled and wired, with motors, sensors, and controllers functioning as intended. Remote communication delays were measured at ~6–7 ms, and inference 
          speeds reached 2026 Hz on the Raspberry Pi and 20,066 Hz on the Steam Deck, far exceeding the 200 Hz requirement. Reinforcement learning models successfully executed standing and 
          locomotion behaviors in simulation, demonstrating the potential for robust real world deployment. The project not only delivered a functional platform but also provided valuable 
          experience in mechanical design, embedded systems, and machine learning for robotics.
