    Our design integrates <strong>optical imaging</strong> with a mechanical system to capture multiple bolt views
    while also measuring basic physical properties.
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700 max-w-3xl mb-8">
    <li><strong>Optical Inspection:</strong> Bolts are placed on a motorized turntable, and two fixed cameras
    capture head markings, threads, and shank geometry under controlled lighting. Image data feeds into a
    computer vision pipeline, where a pretrained CNN extracts feature maps and an anomaly detection algorithm
    (PaDiM) compares them to authentic bolt distributions.</li>

    <li><strong>Non-Optical Tests:</strong> A digital scale measures weight, a magnetic probe detects alloy
    variations, and resistance is recorded to catch abnormal compositions. These values are compared against
    baselines established from authentic bolts.</li>

    <li><strong>Mechanical Structure:</strong> The setup uses T-slotted framing for modularity, stepper motors
    for bolt rotation, and Raspberry Pi–based control with external cameras. The entire system fits within a
    <em>12” × 12” × 12” cube</em> and weighs under <em>12 lbs</em>, meeting project constraints.</li>
  </ul>
