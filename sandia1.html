      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Overview</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
        Counterfeit bolts pose serious risks in aerospace, defense, and industrial supply chains. They can look
        identical to authentic parts but often fail due to poor materials, improper heat treatment, or missing/false
        markings. Current detection methods are either destructive, inconsistent, or too costly for scalable use.
        Our project aims to create a <strong>nondestructive, portable system</strong> that combines optical inspection
        with simple non-optical tests (weight, resistance, magnetism) to reliably detect counterfeit bolts. The system
        must remain lightweight, compact, and able to evaluate a bolt in minutes.

    <!-- Proposed Design -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Proposed Design</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
        Our design integrates <strong>optical imaging</strong> with a mechanical system to capture multiple bolt views
        while also measuring basic physical properties.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700 max-w-3xl">
        <li><strong>Optical Inspection:</strong> Bolts are placed on a motorized turntable, and two fixed cameras
        capture head markings, threads, and shank geometry under controlled lighting. Image data feeds into a
        computer vision pipeline, where a pretrained CNN extracts feature maps and an anomaly detection algorithm
        (PaDiM) compares them to authentic bolt distributions.</li>

        <li><strong>Non-Optical Tests:</strong> A digital scale measures weight, a magnetic probe detects alloy
        variations, and resistance is recorded to catch abnormal compositions. These values are compared against
        baselines established from authentic bolts.</li>

        <li><strong>Mechanical Structure:</strong> The setup uses T-slotted framing for modularity, stepper motors
        for bolt rotation, and Raspberry Pi–based control with external cameras. The entire system fits within a
        <em>12” × 12” × 12” cube</em> and weighs under <em>12 lbs</em>, meeting project constraints.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700 max-w-3xl">
        <li>Collect larger, labeled datasets spanning multiple grades, finishes, and manufacturers.</li>

        <li>Integrate real-time classification on the Raspberry Pi or a lightweight GPU board (e.g., Jetson).</li>
        <li>Improve mechanical reliability of the turntable and screw-holding system for repeatable imaging.</li>
        <li>Design a user interface that clearly outputs pass/fail results with traceable test data.</li>
