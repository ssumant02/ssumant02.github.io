       The Spaceship Rope Crawler was designed as an inverted walker capable of autonomously traversing a suspended rope.
        The main goals were to achieve a minimum speed of 2 m/min, maintain stability under rope vibrations, and fit within 
        compact design constraints. The final design used a slider-leg mechanism powered by a single motor and a double ratchet 
        system to enable efficient locomotion while resembling a futuristic robot. During testing, the crawler consistently completed 
        rope traverses at an average speed of ~8.3 m/min while maintaining stability. Iterative design and material refinements helped 
        optimize weight distribution and reduce friction, demonstrating how engineering precision can merge with creativity in robotic mobility.

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The project’s goal was to design and build an inverted walker capable of autonomously moving along a suspended rope while 
          following strict performance and dimensional constraints. The main objectives were to achieve a minimum speed of 2 m/min, 
          remain stable against rope vibrations and oscillations, and fit within a compact shoebox-sized envelope. In addition, the 
          design had to reflect a creative robotic theme while using accessible prototyping materials. These requirements shaped the 
          development of the Space Shuttle-themed rope crawler, which combined engineering functionality with imaginative aesthetics.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">How</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The crawler used a slider-crank mechanism powered by a DC motor and paired with a double ratchet system for one-way motion along the rope. 
          The drivetrain was prototyped with 3D-printed ratchets before switching to more reliable cam cleats. The frame combined laser-cut acrylic 
          and 3D-printed parts, while <strong>Fusion 360 CAD software</strong> and PVA analysis guided design iterations. The overall look was styled 
          after a Space Shuttle, blending functional engineering with a creative theme.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Results</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Testing showed the crawler exceeded all goals, averaging 8.3 m/min—well above the 2 m/min requirement—while maintaining stability even on vibrating 
          ropes. Iterative refinements improved grip and weight distribution, eliminating slippage and ensuring reliable traversal. The final design was compact, 
          efficient, and visually engaging, proving the effectiveness of the slider ratchet system.
